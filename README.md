# Stegonography

To use steg.exe, you must input the command:
steg -e <original image name> <modified image name> [input ASCII text file name] for encryption
OR
steg -d <modified image name> [output ASCII text file name] for decryption

This program will encrypt a secret message into a PNG that can be submitted by adding the text file name as shown above
or by typing it in to the console after running the command. You can then decrypt the photo using the above command
and have it output to a text file or directly to the console.
